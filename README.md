# HumidiStat Demo App

This is an animation demonstration of a beautiful design by [@ElijahBozniak](https://dribbble.com/shots/6315218-IoT-Humidity-App-Slider). Actually, it's implemented partially because of time limitation and some library bugs (which prevented me from making it as real as possible).

### What about IOS?

I have to say that there is no IOS version, simply because i don't have a IOS development setup. Blame Apple for that :unamused:
